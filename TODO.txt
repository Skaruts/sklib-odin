			TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- rendering
	. fix shader rendering
	. improve quad rendering with custom batches or something


- memory clean up
	. fovmaps / circle masks still leaking
	. font texture needs to be unloaded
		- double-check all images too
		- note: fonts should NOT be destroyed by consoles


- conventions
	. maybe use 'thing_new' instead of 'new_thing'


- input
	. (fixed?) action release sometimes gets triggered twice
	. add mouse/gamepad support
	. maybe key timers should be unified?
	. input-blocking loop


- consoles
	. move console files into a module? (probably hard to do)
	. console cell size override isn't accounted for in many places yet



- fov
- cellmaps
- map generation
- pathfinding
- image blitting to consoles
- rexpaint loader
